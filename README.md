# Card_game

Algorithm 

Step 1   :   Start
Step 2   :   create cards(6)
Step 3   :   declare empty list outdated, and round_count, scores,special_spells, prev_round_winner
Step 4   :   Shuffle the cards
             shuffle(deck)
Step 5   :  Roll a dice using 
            random.randint(1,6)
Step 5.1 :  Display the results 
Step 6   :  Append the outdated deck and reshuffle 
            self.outdated.append(char)
            shuffle(self.outdated)
        
Step 7   : randomly pick a card and update outdated_deck

Step 8   : randomly select an integer r and 
           if r is 1 then "god spell"
           if r is 2 then "resurrect spell"
           else return None 

Step 9   : if spell is resurrect then pick one random card from outdated cards and players card 
           if spell is god then pick a random card from players cardsAlgorithm
